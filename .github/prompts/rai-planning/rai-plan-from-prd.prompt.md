# RAI Plan from PRD/BRD

Activate the RAI Planner in **from-prd mode** to assess AI-specific risks for project slug `${input:project-slug}`.

## Requirements

### PRD/BRD Discovery

Scan for product and business requirements documents:

**Primary paths:**

- `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/` for PRD artifacts
- `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/` for BRD artifacts

**Secondary scan:**

Search the workspace for files matching `*prd*`, `*brd*`, `*product-requirements*`, or `*business-requirements*` patterns.

Present discovered artifacts:

- ✅ Found artifacts with file paths and brief descriptions
- ❌ Missing artifact locations

If zero artifacts are found, fall back to capture mode and explain the switch.

### AI System Scope Extraction

Extract from the discovered artifacts:

1. Project name and AI system purpose
2. AI components and model types
3. Technology stack and deployment targets
4. Data classification and data flow
5. Stakeholder roles (developers, operators, affected individuals)
6. Intended use scenarios and user populations

### State Initialization

Create the project directory at `.copilot-tracking/rai-plans/${input:project-slug}/`.

Initialize `state.json` with:

- `entryMode` set to `"from-prd"`
- `currentPhase` set to `1`
- Pre-populated fields from the extracted scope

### Phase 1 Entry

Present the extracted AI system scope as a checklist with markers:

- ✅ Items confirmed from PRD/BRD
- ❓ Items that need clarification or are missing

Ask 3 to 5 clarifying questions that target AI-specific gaps not covered by the requirements documents, such as model selection rationale, training data provenance, fairness considerations, and unintended use scenarios.
