Install HVE Core collections as Copilot CLI plugins for terminal-based
AI-assisted development workflows.

## Prerequisites

* GitHub Copilot CLI installed and authenticated
* Git symlink support enabled (Windows: Developer Mode +
  `git config --global core.symlinks true`)

## Register hve-core as a Plugin Marketplace

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/hve-core
```

## Browse Available Plugins

Type `/plugin` in a Copilot CLI chat session to browse available plugins.

## Install a Plugin

Choose **one** of the following plugins to install. Each command installs a
different collection from the hve-core marketplace.

For the core Research, Plan, Implement, Review lifecycle:

```bash
copilot plugin install hve-core@hve-core
```

For the full bundle (includes everything in `hve-core` plus all additional
collections):

```bash
copilot plugin install hve-core-all@hve-core
```

> [!TIP]
> `hve-core-all` is a superset of `hve-core`. Install one or the other, not
> both. If you are unsure which to pick, start with `hve-core-all` for the
> complete experience.

## Plugin Contents

Each plugin includes:

| Component    | CLI Discovery | Description                                        |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Agents       | Yes           | Custom chat agents for specialized workflows       |
| Commands     | Yes           | Task prompts accessible via the CLI                |
| Skills       | Yes           | Self-contained skill packages (hve-core-all only)  |
| Instructions | No            | Included for `#file:` references, not auto-applied |

Artifacts are symlinked from the plugin directory to the source repository,
enabling zero-copy installation.

## Limitations

### Instructions are not auto-applied from plugins

The Copilot CLI [plugin spec](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference)
recognizes `agents`, `skills`, `commands`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and
`lspServers` as component types. There is no `instructions` component type.

The CLI loads path-specific instructions exclusively from
`.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` in the
[project repo](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-instructions-support#copilot-cli).
Instruction files in plugin directories are **not** auto-applied via `applyTo`
pattern matching.

Instruction files are still included in plugin output because agents and
prompts reference them via `#file:` directives. Those cross-file references
resolve correctly within the plugin directory tree. The difference is between
explicit inclusion (an agent pulls in instruction content at execution time)
and automatic application (the CLI matches `applyTo` patterns against the
files you are editing).

For full path-specific instruction behavior, copy instruction files into your
project's `.github/instructions/` directory.

### Other limitations

* Skills require skill-compatible agent environments
