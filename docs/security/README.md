## Security Posture

HVE Core is an enterprise prompt engineering framework that:

* Contains no runtime services or user data storage
* Operates as development-time tooling consumed by GitHub Copilot
* Relies on defense-in-depth with 20+ automated security controls

The [security model](security-model.md) documents:

* 36 threats across STRIDE, AI-specific, and Responsible AI categories
* Security controls mapped to each threat
* MCP server trust analysis
* Quantitative security metrics
* GSN-style assurance argument
